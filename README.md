# Document-Based TextSynth Chatbot

## Overview

This project implements a chatbot that leverages documents to generate responses. It uses advanced natural language processing techniques to understand user queries and provide accurate answers based on the content of the provided documents.

## Features

- **Document Parsing**: Automatically reads and extracts relevant information from various document formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT).
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Utilizes NLP algorithms to comprehend user inputs and match them with document content.
- **Contextual Responses**: Generates responses that are contextually relevant to the user's questions.
- **Multi-Document Support**: Can process and respond based on multiple documents at once.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use chat interface for seamless interaction.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementation.
- **Natural Language Processing Libraries**: Libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, or Transformers for NLP tasks.
- **Document Processing Libraries**: Libraries such as PyPDF2, python-docx, or similar for document handling.
- **FastAPI**: Frameworks for building the chat interface (if applicable).
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment.
